# EpicBid - Project Documentation

## System Overview

EpicBid is a modern web application built using React and Vite, designed to provide a robust bidding and auction platform. The system is structured with a focus on user experience, performance, and maintainability.

### Architecture

The project follows a component-based architecture with the following key structural elements:

1. **Frontend Structure**
   - React-based Single Page Application (SPA)
   - Component-based architecture for modular development
   - Context-based state management
   - Responsive design using Tailwind CSS

2. **Directory Structure**
   ```
   src/
   ├── Components/     # Reusable UI components
   ├── Routes/         # Application routing logic
   ├── Context/        # State management context
   ├── hooks/          # Custom React hooks
   ├── assets/         # Static assets
   └── main.jsx        # Application entry point
   ```
